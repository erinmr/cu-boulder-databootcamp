## Welcome to my CU-Boulder Data Bootcamp Project Site 
I took the [CU-Boulder Data Bootcamp](https://cu-boulder-crdds.github.io/data_bootcamp/) from August 3-5, 2021. During Day 1, I built this site during the [hands-on portion](https://cu-boulder-crdds.github.io/data_bootcamp/GH_Pages_Materials/GH-Pages-Hands-On.html) and updated it as part of the microbadge credential process throughout the course.  


## My Project - Recreate key findings from 'State of Open At University of Colorado Baseline report' 
Following the session on Day 3 that shared CUScholar, I noticed the dataset supporting the 'State of Open at University of Colorado Baseline' report. The report included four key findings and my research question was: 'is it possible to reproduce the finding results with the data shared?'

In addition to my project, I did the R Data Visualization Assessment work from Day 2 and it is shared [here](https://erinmr.github.io/cu-boulder-databootcamp-project/R_codeexample.html).
