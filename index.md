## Welcome to my CU-Boulder Data Bootcamp Landing Page 
I took the [CU-Boulder Data Bootcamp](https://cu-boulder-crdds.github.io/data_bootcamp/). During Day 1, I built this site during the [hands-on portion](https://cu-boulder-crdds.github.io/data_bootcamp/GH_Pages_Materials/GH-Pages-Hands-On.html) and updated as part of the microbadge credential process throughout the course.  


#### My Project:
I will use a [Tidy Tuesday Dataset on plastics](https://github.com/sarahsauve/TidyTuesdays/blob/master/BFFPDashboard/BlogPost.md)
