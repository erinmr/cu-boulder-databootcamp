## Welcome to my CU-Boulder Data Bootcamp Landing Page 
I took the [CU-Boulder Data Bootcamp](https://cu-boulder-crdds.github.io/data_bootcamp/). During Day 1, I built this site during the [hands-on portion](https://cu-boulder-crdds.github.io/data_bootcamp/GH_Pages_Materials/GH-Pages-Hands-On.html) and updated as part of the microbadge credential process throughout the course.  


## My Project 
Discussion 
- What are some examples of scholarly data and ethical concerns do you handle/encounter
- Power and justice resonated 
- What does the dataset capture 
- What do I wish I could learn about the data origins 
- What data are missing? How might that be useful 
- How might thinking of data as a text change how you document and share your work
