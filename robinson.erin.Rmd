## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r perform-math }
# perform addition
a <- 1+2
b <- 234

# subtract a from b
final_answer <- b - a

# write out the final answer variable
final_answer
```

```{r math-part-two }

   # More math2!
   a * b

   a * b / final_answer 
```

 ## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r testing-arguments, eval = FALSE }

   # More math!
   a * b

   a * b / final_answer
 ```

 ```{r testing-arguments, echo=FALSE }
    # More math!
    a * b

    a * b / final_answer
  ```
