I really enjoyed the morning sessions on CUScholar, FAIR data and data ethics. CUScholar provided the inspiration for my badge project, with [this dataset](https://scholar.colorado.edu/catalog?f%5Bresource_type_sim%5D%5B%5D=Data+Set&q=open+access&search_field=all_fields) 

Note to self: Don't use GitHub data storage 

In the afternoon, I was happy that based on my prior Software Carpentries set-up that my setup worked and I was able to fork the repo for Python session and open the notebook using JupyterLab on my computer. The python session covered A LOT of ground, but the notebook is terrific and provides lots of examples to come back to.
