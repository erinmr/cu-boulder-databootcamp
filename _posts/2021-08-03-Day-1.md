# Day 1 Take Aways
The big take-aways from Day 1 of bootcamp were how to make a website using Jekyll and GitHub Pages on a repo. Any repo can become a website by changing pages setting to point to Main branch and then url will be username . github.io / repo name. 

In the afternoon we covered Docker. I installed Docker and created a Docker Hub account. As a next step I would like to access a Docker image.
