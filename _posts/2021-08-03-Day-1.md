# Day 1 Take Aways
The big take-aways from Day 1 of bootcamp were how to make a website using Jekyll and GitHub Pages on a repo. Any repo can become a website by changing pages setting to point to Main branch and then url will be username . github.io / repo name. One other thing I learned was how to include R Markdown pages in a Jekyll site by stating that the rmd output should be md. Details are [here](https://jchellmuth.com/news/jekyll/website/code/2020/01/04/Rmarkdown-posts-to-Jekyll.html). 

In the afternoon we covered Docker. I installed Docker and created a Docker Hub account. As a next step I would like to access a Docker image.
