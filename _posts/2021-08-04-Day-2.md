# Day 2 

Day 2 covered R and Rstudio. I forked the repo for the class and then cloned the repo into RStudio. I followed along with the instructor in my own version of RStudio. I thought the five thirty eight package was very cool and liked ggplot. 

I made this [R Markdown file](https://erinmr.github.io/cu-boulder-databootcamp-project/R_codeexample.html) following the class to practice.
